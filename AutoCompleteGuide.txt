The autocomplete control can be used as a textbox with auto suggestions based on what the user types. The control will give all the suggestions initially,
and will filter down the list based on the user input.



IsMultiSelect could be set to true to use select multiple items at a time. If this property is set to false, only one item can be selected at a time.

MaxDropDownHeight="70" could be used in AutoCompleteUC for key "ComboAutoComplete" to control the items height.
